As a result, we see a promising potential to significantly empower our decision-making process by providing relevant information just in time/space. In this paper, we present AfterMath, a user interface concept of predicting and visualizing consequences of a user’s potential actions. We explore new possibilities through a prototypical system that harnesses physics simulation as a consequence-prediction method and uses augmented reality technology to visualize potential consequences. Finally, we suggest general guidelines for designing systems utilizing this concept.","Sang-won Leigh","sangwon@mit.edu","1. http://bulletphysics.org/ \ 2. http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/ \ 3. https://www.qualcomm.com/products/vuforia \ 4.

We have evaluated the proposed AMTS system in indoor and outdoor environments. The evaluation results indicate that the AMTS system could be useful to automatically signal turns. We also conducted a survey of the questionnaire. \ The survey result shows that the AMTS system is highly appreciated by the motorcyclists.","Bo-Han Chen","smilekerry@gmail.com","1.

However, very little is known about contexts of game use in real-world rehabilitation settings. In this paper, we explore contexts of commercial game use in BI therapy through observation of inpatient therapy sessions. Based on a systematic analysis of the observation recordings, we found that (1) only 30% of session time was used for gameplay; (2) therapists needed to provide various kinds of cognitive and physical patient support during the play sessions; and (3) therapists adopted multiple strategies to reinforce the therapeutic values of the games. This study is helping us create decision and information sharing tools to support the use and creation of games for BI rehabilitation.","Jinghui Cheng","jcheng13@cdm.depaul.edu","1.

Although well trained, these heroes need to manage complex problems and make life-or-death decisions while handling the unknown and dangerous. We are motivated to explore how Google Glass can facilitate those heroes' missions. To this end, we conducted contextual inquiry on six biohazard-handling, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)-wearing professionals. With an inductive thematic analysis, we summarized the heroes' workflow and four groups of ""Heroes' Problems"". A unique ""A3 Model"" (Awareness, Analysis, Action) was generated to encapsulate our qualitative findings and proposed Glass features. The findings serve as the groundwork for our future development.","Jack Shen-Kuen Chang","jackskchang@gmail.com","1.

However, there are two problems with current tabletop displays: The display area is limited to horizontal surfaces, and there is a lack of view-dependent appearance regarding displayed images. The aim of this paper is to overcome these limitations by adding dual-sided vertical mid-air images to a horizontal surface for a richer and more impressive visual presentation. For this purpose, we introduce a plate-shaped mid-air imaging optics as a tabletop surface and a diffusion control film for the projection of horizontal images. The proposed system, ""HoVerTable,"" can display a combination of horizontal and vertical images for users facing each other. We have developed interactive applications on HoVerTable, including a card battle game and an application for the augmentation of physical objects.","Hanyuool Kim","hanyuool@nae-lab.org","1.

There is a growing interest in using narrative techniques to support the interpretation and understanding of such data. In this early study we explore methods of selecting images from personal Instagram accounts in the form of a triptych (a sequence of three images) in order to create a sense of narrative. We present a brief description of the algorithms behind image selection, evaluate how effective they are in creating a sense of narrative, and discuss the wider implications of our work. Results show that semantic tagging, a dynamic programming algorithm, and a simple narrative structure produced triptychs which were significantly more story-like, with a significantly more coherent order, than a random selection, or a neutral sequence of images.","Matthew Aylett","matthewaylett@gmail.com","1.

This is realized through simulating changes in the perception of various material properties, such as softness and bendability. The thereby created perceptual illusions of surface changes are induced using electrotactile stimuli and texture projection as touch/pressure feedback. A metal plate with an embedded electrode was used to provide the user with electrotactile stimuli when touching the surface with a finger that is also equipped with an electrode. The distortion of material textures projected on the touched surface was used to visually simulate surface deformations. We show through an experiment that both, electrotactile and visual feedback can induce the illusion of surface deformation when provided separately. When tactile and visual touch feedback is presented at the same time, the perception of surface changes does not increase compared to just using one feedback modality only.","Katrin Wolf","k4trin.wolf@gmail.com","1.

We collected data through open post-hoc interviews and analyzed the qualitative data using Open Coding. The participants showed very strong and polarized opinions towards notification alerts. During work, some participants felt less stressed and more productive thanks to not being interrupted, however outside of the work context, some became stressed and anxious because they were afraid of missing important information and violating expectations of others. This is the first holistic approach to notifications studying their effect across services, devises and work and private life. In contrast to previous studies, some participants acted upon the positive experiences and turned notifications of some applications off.","Martin Pielot","martin.pielot@gmail.com","1.

While existing tools facilitate and support such collaborative efforts (e.g., Dropbox, Google Docs), these tools lack intelligent information sharing mechanisms. Capabilities such as ``track changes’’ and ``diff’’ visualize changes to authors, but do not distinguish between minor and major edits and do not consider the possible effects of edits on other parts of the document. Drawing collaborators' attention to specific edits and describing them remains the responsibility of authors. This paper presents our initial work toward the development of a collaborative system that supports multi-author writing. We describe methods for tracking paragraphs, identifying significant edits, and predicting parts of the paper that are likely to require changes as a result of previous edits. Preliminary evaluation of these methods shows promising results. ","Ofra Amir","oamir@seas.harvard.edu","1. Birnholtz, J., Steinhardt, S., and Pavese, A.

It highlights an emerging interest in personal digital archiving and sees this as a fruitful area for more transformative forms of cross disciplinary working. A study is described in which an attempt is made to expose and actively engage UK based archivists and records managers with a selection of literature and research about personal digital archiving taken from the ACM Digital Library. The aim of the study was to see what, if anything, could be learnt through this process and whether, and in what way, such interaction might engender new insight and innovation. Although little new insight and innovation were so engendered, the study still makes a contribution as a provocation to reflect on cross disciplinary working and its importance for shaping new fields of study such as personal digital archiving.","Jenny Bunn","j.bunn@ucl.ac.uk","1.

In this publication, we focus on tangibles that provide input and output channels by spatially relocating a part of the touch input and visual output area from the touch screen onto their own arbitrarily shaped surface. Optical fibers that transmit light between the widget's base and its surface can be used for this purpose, but input on such tangibles only works on vision based, not on capacitive touch screens, and it forces input and output to be co-located on the surface of the tangible, excluding designs with spatially separated input and output channels, for example, back-of-device interaction. \  \ We propose Transporter tangibles that exploit the technological separation of input and output channels in current capacitive touch screens. By integrating thin conductive wires into optical fiber based widgets, we can apply independent spatial transformations to both channels. This technique allows us to create tangible widgets in which the arrangement, scale, and shape of the input and output surfaces on the tangible can be designed independently and flexibly. A series of use cases illustrates the possibilities of this technology. We also explore the space of construction parameters for widgets that reliably transmit touch.","Florian Heller","flo@cs.rwth-aachen.de","1. Baudisch, P., Becker, T., and Rudeck, F.

When the user smiles, both a photo and a screenshot are recorded and saved to the user’s profile for later review. Based on positive psychology research, we hypothesize that the act of reviewing content that led to smiles will improve positive affect, and consequently, overall wellbeing.

The availability of large, responsive pools of workers means that low quality work can often be treated as noise and dealt with through standard data processing techniques. This approach is not practical in all scenarios though, so efforts have been made to stop poor performance occurring by preventing satisficing behaviours that can compromise result quality. In this paper we test an intervention – a task lockout – designed to prevent satisficing behaviour in a simple data-entry task on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our results show that workers are highly adaptable: when faced with the intervention they develop workaround strategies, allocating their time elsewhere during lockout periods. This suggests that more subtle techniques may be required to substantially influence worker behaviour.","Sandy Gould","s.gould@cs.ucl.ac.uk","1. Buhrmester, M., Kwang, T., and Gosling, S.D.

However, all participants in these studies were only Japanese, so if the participants’ mother tongue has different sensitivity to variations in pitch compared with Japanese, the interpretations of the ASEs might be different. We then investigated whether the ASEs are interpreted in the same way as with Japanese regardless of the users’ mother tongues; specifically we focused on three language categories in traditional phonological typology. We conducted a web-based experiment to investigate whether the ways speakers of German, Portuguese (stress accent language), Mandarin Chinese (tone language) and Japanese (pitch accent language) interpret the ASEs are different or not.

Although current technology allows customization of default playback speeds to cater to individual students’ desired pace, we highlight a need for more dynamic or reactive control systems capable of varying playback in response to viewer needs or activities (e.g. slowing down during note-taking). This article instantiates this idea by describing a system that tracks a user’s head position in order to infer and respond to their activities whilst watching an educational video. We describe the design and implementation of the system and a user study that highlights usage patterns and shows automatic tracking and playback speed adjustment can effectively lower users’ workload.","Sunghyun Song","boss.ssong@gmail.com","1.

Three bi-cultural aspects have emerged and are presented here: the need for a bi-lingual noticeboard to span both oral and written language traditions; the tension between perfunctory information exchange and social, embodied protocols of telling in person and the different ways in which time is represented in both cultures. The design approach, developed iteratively through consultation, demonstration and testing led to an “unsurprising interface” aimed at maximizing use and appropriation across cultures by unifying visual, text and spoken contents in both passive and interactive displays in a modeless manner.

We hypothesize that learning underlies the sustained use of these devices and that it is therefore important to consider how user needs and competence develop over time to design engaging and appropriable systems. Our preliminary results show that displays prompt reflexivity about energy issues and, as questions emerge, they need to be addressed by a range of adapted systems (eco-feedback systems, control systems and relational programs).","Myriam FREJUS","myriam.frejus@edf.fr","1.

Such a functionality is not only helpful for problem solving in the general production system itself, but can also be used for other specific aspects of it, e.g. errors requiring documentation in the manual end-assembly that can also profit from the same strategies.

We propose an active camera system called ""Laughin'Cam"" that obtains natural-looking portraits by eliciting spontaneous smiles by presenting the sound of laughter. The proposed system utilizes an emotional contagion effect, which is the tendency of emotional behavior to spread from person to person. We conducted an evaluation experiment with our proposed system using computer vision and also performed a subjective experiment.

The aim is typically to change user routines, which does not bring a long-lasting impact. In our case study, we address these concerns for apartment buildings by looking at housing cooperatives, the dominant form of apartment ownership in the Nordic countries. These cooperatives manage the heating costs in common and therefore have a large potential for energy saving through long-lasting improvements and investments. We also emphasise the amateur nature of energy work within such cooperatives and consider the implications of our field study findings, interpreted through these amateur and cooperative perspectives, for the design of interactive artefacts.","Hanna Hasselqvist","hannaha@kth.se","1.

This applies to both personal contexts (e.g. checking banking information in a coffee shop) and professional contexts (e.g. sharing patient information in a hospital ward). It is important to explore ways to support visual privacy that are appropriate for mobile device use in public settings and in dynamic workflows. In this paper we present the design, prototype implementation, and ongoing evaluation of a range of privacy notifications and privacy control mechanisms for tablets. Preliminary results show that: 1) spatial information such as distance and orientation can be used to mediate privacy management for tablet interfaces. 2) Privacy notifications and control mechanisms should be designed to complement our existing physical awareness and protection mechanisms. 3) Selecting a specific design is highly context-dependent.

Despite rapid technological progress, the community lacks a common programming model for developing applications for these visually and physically-dynamic display surfaces. This results in complex, hardware-specific, custom-code that requires significant development effort and prevents researchers from easily building on and sharing their applications across hardware platforms. As a first attempt to address these issues we introduce SDSL, a Shape-Display Shader Language for easily programming shape-changing displays in a hardware-independent manner. We introduce the (graphics-derived) pipeline model of SDSL, an open-source implementation that includes a compiler, runtime, IDE, debugger, and simulator, and show demonstrator applications running on two shape-changing hardware setups.","Christian Weichel","c.weichel@lancaster.ac.uk","1.

However, most of the applications employ only one marker or use them inside a limited interaction space.  Here, we present two applications that try to go beyond these previous limits. Firstly, the PathMaker is a game in which a path in the real world is constructed with tangible markers. Meanwhile, virtual creatures will walk through the path requiring its exploration and maintenance. Secondly, TurtAR is a tangible programming language similar to Logo that uses as parameters several degrees of freedom from the markers. Finally, we present a simple algorithm that works on top of existing tracking libraries and supports multiple markers to track the device as well as to interact with the applications.","Asier Marzo","asier.marzo@unavarra.es","1.

Its novelty resides in the support for 2D exploration over a flat surface and multi-finger capabilities. Marionette is able to apply inclination to four fingers with two degrees of freedom while the user moves the device as if it were a mouse. The device is aimed at enabling a new set of haptic user studies. Preliminary results suggest that the limit of curvature perception in 2D curves is mainly determined by the inclination information while touching with both one and four fingers. Additionally, Marionette supports haptic images such as maps, time changing functions and haptically enhanced telepresence.","Asier Marzo","asier.marzo@unavarra.es","1. Gibson, J. J. 1962.

We use a system put on a table consisting of multiple projectors and depth cameras. The system projects a shared screen and a personal screen per each user on a projection screen and on a table respectively and enables interaction according to the user's hand motion. A personal screen can be operated by touch operations and a shared screen can be operated by pointing with fingers. Touch and pointing direction are recognized from the depth image and the confidence map obtained by a depth camera. We developed an early prototype system for verification and implemented a presentation application that supports collaborative work to the system. This application allows a user to move a window between the shared screen and the personal screen and to perform various operations on the slides.","Shun Sekiguchi","sekiguchi@is.ics.saitama-u.ac.jp","1.

Leaderboards are commonly used to allow players to compare their performance against others’. We sought to examine how leaderboard ranking affected satisfaction with a game and desire to play a game again. In our study, individuals in a second, fourth, or seventh position on the leaderboard reported higher satisfaction than individuals in other positions on the leaderboard. Our results support a potential mechanism that might contribute to game satisfaction from leaderboard position: counterfactual thinking. Future work and implications for the design of leaderboards are discussed.","Emily Sun","es765@cornell.edu","1. Antin, J., & Churchill, E. Badges in Social Media: A Social Psychological Perspective.

As social media is increasingly adopted in health related discourse, we examine how these new platforms might be allowing honest and candid expression of thoughts, experiences and beliefs. Specifically, we seek to detect levels of self-disclosure manifested in posts shared on different mental health forums on Reddit. We develop a classifier for the purpose based on content features. The classifier is able to characterize a Reddit post to be of high, low, or no self-disclosure with 78% accuracy. Applying this classifier to general mental health discourse on Reddit, we find that bulk of such discourse is characterized by high self-disclosure, and that the community responds distinctively to posts that disclose less or more. We conclude with the potential of harnessing our proposed self-disclosure detection algorithm in psychological therapy via social media. We also discuss design considerations for improved community moderation and support in these vulnerable self-disclosing communities. ","Munmun De Choudhury","munmund@gatech.edu","1.	Bak, J., Lin, C.

This is achieved by filtering and analyzing the acoustic signal generated when users walk. To extract the acoustic values of footsteps, we implemented a simple wearable device attached on the user’s ankle. To verify our approach, we conducted a preliminary test using several pattern classification algorithms. The results show that our system achieves an 89.6% average for three different walking styles (best, good, and bad) and 86.9% for four different real-world ground sets (carpet, asphalt, sand, and wood). We believe that our technique can be applied to existing context-aware techniques as well as various unexplored domains in wearable devices.","Sungjae Hwang","sungjae.hwang@futureplay.co","1.

For casual runners music may act as a motivator and distractor of physical strain. It may also serve as a training guide, when sensing technology is used as an enabler for adapting music to a runner’s situation in real-time. While many effects of music are known from sports science and psychology, application designers lack a consolidated knowledge base that guides them in designing a running application. This work synthesizes findings from the involved disciplines and provides 7 requirements for an application that increases casual runners’ motivation and controls training.","Christine Bauer","chris.bauer@wu.ac.at","[1]	Bauer, C. and Waldner, F.

These rules are important public health tools and help protect the environment, among other applications. However, despite their importance, no large-scale database of SURs currently exists. This prevents online/mobile maps from presenting these rules to users, as their traditional paper counterparts have been shown to do regularly. The lack of a SUR database also prevents developers from building novel SUR-based applications, e.g. mobile apps that inform users where they can smoke or walk their dog. In this paper, we present an in-development user interface to support the semi-automatic encoding of SURs expressed in natural language in documents such as laws, city ordinances, park rules, and institution FAQ pages. Our system will allow an untrained user to easily enter complex rules into a spatial data format compatible with OpenStreetMap.","Pavel Samsonov","pavel.samsonov@uhasselt.be","1.

A critical non-verbal mode of communicating is rooted in the expression of emotion which directly relates bodies to the environment. [1, 3, 6, 7, 8] \  \ Computational textiles which transform through electronic commands over time augment the choices and expressions possible for designers to communicate with people using these textiles.  The problem is what exactly is communicated emotionally to people through the transforming textural expressions of the material?  The author presents a study which relates communication of emotion to people via the aesthetic textural expression of computational textiles or textiles which transform through electronic commands over time.  The author presents the preliminary results of the study as one of many methods which when combined with other design methods from architectural design will be used to fabricate a computational textile that can express a range of emotions through its textural transformations \ ","Felecia Davis","fadav@psu.edu","WARNING: These references start with non-alphanumeric characters: 11, 14.

However, most designers feel it difficult to prototype dynamic interactions rather than designing static UIs, since they do not have sufficient programming experiences. Moreover, it is even harder to communicate regarding interactions with developers. To address this issue, we presented a novel prototyping tool, called SNAP, which enables designers to implement sensor-based interactions easily. Our concept was drawn from a natural language programming and microinteraction model. Hence, it does not require any programming skills or schemes. We believe that our approach will shed a light on prototyping works in the design process.","Tony Kim","tony.kim@studioxid.com","1. Bois, E.

This trend generates vast amounts of video material impossible to review manually. However, these recordings also contain a lot of information potentially interesting to the recording individual and to others. Such videos can  provide a meaningful summary of the day, serving as a digital extension to the user's human memory. They might also be interesting to others as tutorials (e.g. how to change a flat tyre). As a first step towards this vision, we present a survey assessing the users' view and their video recording behavior. Findings were used to inform the design of a prototype based on off-the-shelf components, which allows users to create meaningful video clips of their daily activities in an automated manner by using their phone and any wearable camera. We conclude with a preliminary, qualitative study showing the feasibility and potential of the approach and sketch future research directions.","Daniel Buschek","daniel.buschek@ifi.lmu.de","1.

To address the limitations of existing tools, we present miniStudio, a prototyping toolkit for interactive and ubiquitous computing environments larger than human scale. It consists of software and hardware kits for constructing miniature physical spaces and testing dynamic interactions in them through a combination of paper models and Lego. It also supports prototyping for interactivity using projection-based augmented reality with invisible markers and a pro-cam system in instantly created miniature spaces. We applied Adobe Photoshop as an interactivity authoring environment since it is one of the most popular design tools. From the preliminary evaluation with junior designers, miniStudio showed the potential to support the iterative exploration of interactive spaces in the early phases of the design process.","Han-Jong Kim","jong2jong2@kaist.ac.kr","1.

The method uses a patterned contact lens and a single-pixel imaging sensor. Its applicability is explored via a semi-simulated user study, where real eye movements from 50 subjects are used to animate a 3-D graphics replica of an eye wearing a patterned contact lens. An accurate single-pixel camera simulator is used to perform gaze estimation via capturing of the imprinted pattern. The results show the promising potential of the technique in the field of eye tracking and eye gesture recognition.","Ioannis Rigas","rigas@txstate.edu","WARNING: Reference 15 is very long.

Modern web browsers use multiple windows and tabs to support different parallel browsing users’ tasks. Yet, multiple windows and tabs have significant flaws that hinder users’ performance. Our approach attempts to support parallel browsing with an Augmented Reality web browsing environment that mainly relies on Tangible Interaction. To verify our approach, we developed a prototype and carried out a short user-study. In the short user-study, 70% of participants achieved a 21.37% decrease in the time required to complete a comparison task with our prototype. In addition, we found further advantages in flexibility of movement, learning time, and reduced memory load. Finally, we provided a short description about our future direction.","Mohammed AlSada","alsada@dcl.cs.waseda.ac.jp","1. Jeff Huang and Ryen W. White. 2010. Parallel browsing behavior on the web.

In this research we investigate applying gesture interaction and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies to make public information displays more intuitive and easy to use. We focus especially on designing intuitive gesture based interaction methods to use in combination with an augmented virtual mirror interface. As an initial step, we conducted a user study to indentify the gestures that users feel are natural for performing common tasks when interacting with augmented virtual mirror displays. We report initial findings from the study, discuss design guidelines, and suggest future research directions.","Gun Lee","gun.lee@hitlabnz.org","1. Azuma, R. A survey of augmented reality.

Nowadays, there is a consensus among researchers, practitioners and users that current design approaches of CAPTCHA need to be improved in order to provide a fair trade-off solution between security and usability. In this paper, we propose a shift from a generic Human Interaction Proof (HIP) to a more user-friendly Individual Human Interaction Proof (iHIP) approach by incorporating a dynamic and extendable human and technology factor based user-centric framework. Such an approach provides an alternative point of view to current state of the art practices aiming to deliver the best-fit CAPTCHA to each individual by taking into consideration contextual and behavioral interaction data.","Christos Fidas","fidas@upatras.gr","1.

The current state-of-the-art of tactile devices relies primarily on vibrotactile stimulation, which limits the possible sensations that can be created.  There is a wide range of applications for tactile devices mimicking the sensation created by human touch, including mediated social touch and also tactile feedback applications. \  \ The Tickler employs an array of parallel bars that slowly move laterally over the skin in different patterns.  It is underactuated and compliant, so that it can move with the skin of the user.  In this paper we describe the Tickler, consider possible applications and present a preliminary user study. \ ","Espen Knoop","espen.knoop@bristol.ac.uk","1. Bark, K., Wheeler, J.

In an era where networks are becoming increasingly complex, the desirability of tools to compare and contrast sets, relationships, and reach is significant. Motivated by a practical need articulated by corporate decision makers, this research presents our journey in designing and implementing bicentric diagrams, a novel graph-based set visualization technique. A bicentric diagram enables simultaneous identification of sets, set relationships, and set member reach in integrated egonetworks of two focal entities. Our technique builds on the well-established theory of tie strength to visually group and position nodes. We illustrate the applicability of bicentric diagrams with an example from technology co-occurrence in press releases.

This is important as the body of available visualizations on the web is growing. And it the meantime, they are difficult to find as they don't have an immediate textual description. Our approach is first to create a taxonomy of textual terms to describe visualizations, both in a general and in a specific way using economics visualization as application domain. Then we designed and implemented a search engine to query this vocabulary on a real website, The Atlas of Economic Complexity, using economics data. Results from an exploratory study informed us on the types of tasks to support and on the visual design of the search box, such as showing recommendations similar to Google results. Those early and promising results pave the way for a more diverse and complex vocabulary that exploits the full wealth of information that graphical elements can contain. Such a search feature has wide ranging applicability, from making visualizations more accessible for less technical users, to using other input modalities such as voice.","Romain Vuillemot","romain.vuillemot@gmail.com","1.

However, these additional taxonomies can distract the user from reaching their music goal, and influence choice satisfaction. We conducted an online user study with an application called ""Tune-A-Find,"" where we measured participants' music taxonomy choice (mood, activity, and genre).  Among 297 participants, we found that the chosen taxonomy is related to personality traits. We found that openness to experience increased the choice for browsing music by mood, while conscientiousness increased the choice for browsing music by activity. In addition, those high in neuroticism were most likely to browse for music by activity or genre. Our findings can support music streaming services to further personalize user interfaces. By knowing the user's personality, the user interface can adapt to the user's preferred way of music browsing.","Bruce Ferwerda","bruce.ferwerda@jku.at","1. Bollen, D., Knijnenburg, B.

To address this problem, we present ApplianceReader - a system that combines a wearable point-of-view camera with on-demand crowdsourcing and computer vision to make appliance interfaces accessible. ApplianceReader sends photos of appliance interfaces that it has not seen previously to the crowd, who work in parallel to quickly label and describe elements of the interface. Computer vision techniques then track the user's finger pointing at the controls and read out the labels previously provided by the crowd. This enables visually impaired users to interactively explore and use appliances without asking the crowd repetitively. ApplianceReader broadly demonstrates the potential of hybrid approaches that combine human and machine intelligence to effectively realize intelligent, interactive access technology today.","Anhong Guo","anhongg@cs.cmu.edu","1.

CrowdFound allows users to input lost item descriptions on a map and then sends notifications to users passing near tagged areas. To assess the system’s efficacy, we conducted interviews and user testing on CrowdFound. Our results show that users were able to find lost items when using a combination of the notification, map, and item description features. In addition, users were willing to deviate off path to look for lost items, particularly when exercising.  Our findings also suggest socio-technical features to promote more effective on-the-go crowdsourced help on microtasks. This research builds our understanding of physical crowdsourcing as a tool for solving societal problems and suggests broader implications for utilizing mobile crowds.","Emily Harburg","eharburg@gmail.com","1.

Today, online systems are increasingly being viewed as an effective solution for their ability to reach broad populations. As online support groups become popular the workload for human moderators increases. Maintaining quality feedback becomes increasingly challenging as the community grows. Tools that can automatically detect mental health problems from social media posts and then generate smart feedback can greatly reduce human overload. In this paper, we present a system for the automation of interventions using Natural Language Generation (NLG) techniques. In particular, we focus on ‘depression’ and ‘anxiety’ related interventions. Psychologists evaluated the quality of the systems’ interventions and results were compared against human (i.e. moderator) interventions. Results indicate our intervention system still has a long way to go, but is a step in the right direction as a tool to assist human moderators with their service.","M.

The traditional tools of presenting external image, such as mirrors or videos, are limited in their mobility, perspective, and immediacy. To address the issue, we present OutsideMe, a vision-sync mixed reality system that enables dancers see their body movements as external observers through a head-mounted display (HMD) device. This system captures dancer’s posture and blends it into scenes from the dancer’s original field of view in an interactive frame rate. The dancers can observe themselves without distracting their presence identities. In this research, we develop four work modes for supporting dancer’s training, and carry out a feasibility study and a user study. The feedbacks from the participants performing various dancing styles are analyzed and discussed. The preliminary experimental results support our design.","Shuo Yan","shuoyan@bit.edu.cn","1.

The algorithm is based on the intuition that the importance of a design should depend on the rank of the users that created and promoted it, and the importance of a user should depend on the rank of the designs he creates and promotes in turn. The algorithm produces design rankings that are positively correlated with existing social metrics such as number of likes, but also allows designs with second-order social import to rise through the ranks. We demonstrate that the algorithm converges, and analyze the rankings it produces on both simulated and scraped social design networks.","Ranjitha Kumar","ranjitha@illinois.edu","1.

However, existing explorations in this area have mostly focused on using screens to graphically report physical activity data such as heart rate. The use of edible mediums such as 3D printed food for representing such data opens up new possibilities and challenges to push the field forward. Supporting this, we present EdiPulse that 3D prints in chocolates, personalized cheerful messages and emoticons, displaying heart rate data from physical activity session. By varying the thickness of the printed letters and emoticons, the system also supports abstract visualization of the heart rate data, while the printed chocolate incentivizes participation in physical activity. Ultimately, with this work, we aim to inspire and guide design thinking on food printing and edible quantified self representations, which we believe opens up new interaction possibilities to support the physical activity experience.","Rohit Ashok Khot","rohit.a.khot@gmail.com","1.

Recent literature suggested that MIMs can support users to “dwell” together with their close relationships by constantly exchanging tidbits of their lives. In this paper, we present an interview study to investigate why and how people use WeChat, particularly focusing on its three novel opportunistic social features: Shake, Drift Bottle, and Look Around. Drawing from 25 interviews, our results suggest that WeChat usage was motivated by a wide range of user needs. Notably, we found these social features supporting fleeting encounters among strangers. The seemingly conflicting practices of dwelling with close people and fleeting encounters with strangers vividly co-existed in the WeChat social space. These results suggest that MIMs as a rich design space for supporting divergent social interactions.","Yang Wang","ywang@syr.edu","1. Church, K., and de Oliveira, R.

Previous work has shown that visual feedback improves such actions. However, haptic feedback can increase the realism or also help for occluded targets. Here we investigate if 3D virtual hand selection benefits from electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) and vibration. In our experiment we used a 3D version of a Fitts’ task to compare visual, EMS, vibration, and no feedback. The results demonstrate that both EMS and vibration are reasonable alternatives to visual feedback. We also found good user acceptance for both technologies.","Max Pfeiffer","max.pfeiffer@hci.uni-hannover.de","1. Achibet, M., et al.

Recent developments in mobile computing have enabled ubiquitous monitoring of walking activity via the smartphone accelerometers. Typically, walking apps map accelerometer values to caloric values through a calibration algorithm. However, these calibration algorithms assume a flat surface, which is not always true and can introduce significant errors. In this paper, we outline a novel calibration method that estimates surface inclination for uphill walking thus, improving the caloric estimation in mobile walking apps.

Moreover, we investigate whether plants could offer a new dimension of interaction and emotional attachment to computer interfaces. We conducted a study to observe people’s interactions with prototype plant-based systems, and also interviewed them about future usage of plants in HCI. Our early findings indicate that using a plant-based interface triggered emotive connections, making interactions more enjoyable.

However, there are negative aspects to using this kind of software, for example, it has been found that people communicating in the text-chat environment may experience a lack of trust and may face different levels of cognitive load [1, 11]. This study examines a novel way to measure interpersonal trust and cognitive load when they overlap with each other in the text-chat environment. We used Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), a physiological measurement, to collect data from twenty-eight subjects at four gradients and overlapping conditions between trust and cognitive load. The findings show that the GSR signals were significantly affected by both trust and cognitive load and provide promising evidence that GSR can be used as a tool for measuring interpersonal trust when cognitive load is low and also for measuring cognitive load when trust is high.","Ahmad Khawaji","ahmad.khawaji@nicta.com.au","1.

It is expected that emotional communication will be richer when including the use of the tactile sense. This study focuses on textures as tactile stimuli and investigates relationships between texture and emotion that can be evoked or conveyed by the textures as communication media. Results show which emotion is evoked in association with each of the texture characteristics, and that these textures could be used to convey emotional information.","Yurika Ebe","ebe.y.aa@m.titech.ac.jp","1.

This work focuses on systematic plant manipulation for affective individual feedback. Building on centuries of explicit plant manipulation and recent work in HCI, we explore the combination of personal informatics and plant-mediated feedback. We argue that plant-based information displays could offer affective, multi-sensorial and sometimes ambiguous signs for users. We describe our plant manipulation system and report the results of four experiments in this novel design space. We provide guidelines and suggestions for how designers can incorporate plant-based information displays into their work and conclude by exploring specific domains where plant-based displays could be effective as information displays for personal behavior, harnessing their accepted use in everyday settings and affective affordances.","Jacqueline Chien","jtc229@cornell.edu","1.

AtmoSPHERE uses a Microsoft Kinect to monitor and extract movement in a room and then visualizes representations of this movement physically via sand traces on a custom built XY sandbox table.

In this work we discuss the requirements for the design of unobtrusive technologies to support the communication between patients and their relatives. We also present design concepts and prototypes based on these requirements. These devices are especially useful when illness inhibits the patient from using conventional methods of communication or if the patient doesn't wish to burden their loved ones with the depth of intimacy they crave.","Torben Wallbaum","torben.wallbaum@offis.de","WARNING: Reference 4 is very long.

To bridge different languages, interactive translation that involves non-experts to iterate the inputs of machine translation (MT) for better translations can be useful. However, there is a design issue on how to provide feedback of estimated translation quality to support workers’ iterative editing actions. In a lab study, we evaluated the effects of different types of interface feedback (back translation, numeric score of estimated translation quality, and anthropomorphic social messages). The results confirmed the utility of using numeric score and social messages as feedback, and shed light on the design of MT interface and cross-lingual communication support.","Hsing-Lin Tsai","hltsai9@gmail.com","1.

To find more effective ways of delivering health information to users, this study examined the psychological effects of forms of health feedback (comparative vs. non-comparative) and presentation modes (text vs. image) on users’ tendencies toward health conservation. Results from a between-subjects experiment (N = 40) revealed that health information in a comparative and textual format was more effective in encouraging health conservation in participants than identical information presented in a non-comparative and image format. In addition, participants’ level of health consciousness emerged as a significant predictor. The implications of the key findings are discussed.","Ki Joon Kim","veritate@skku.edu","1.

Our system, FeedLearn, teaches vocabulary in the context of Facebook feeds, by showing users interactive quizzes they can answer without leaving their feeds. It is implemented as a Chrome extension, as Facebook's API does not currently allow developers to insert interactive content into feeds. In our preliminary user study, we compared Japanese vocabulary learning rates when interactive quizzes were inserted directly into feeds, versus inserting links that lead them to quizzes. Our results suggest that users learn more and engage more with microlearning tasks when quizzes can be done without leaving their feeds.","Geza Kovacs","geza@cs.stanford.edu","1. Beaudin, J.

In our project we try to explore such an issue over taste interactions and empathy inscribed in food. We have designed 'StreetSauce', an interactive service with edible interface that conveys public engagement in the problem of female homelessness. Within this paper, we present preliminary results of our research related to the StreetSauce project. The data sampled so far come from interviews, participant observation at design probes, and online questionnaire.

In particular, we were interested in how different placement types—with their inherent text appearance and layout changes—affect readers. We designed a quantitative study in which we gave sentences with or without visualizations for participants to read. Then, we invited them to answer questions on the sentences. We found that the information encoded in the visualizations is more prominent and easily remembered than information in the written text, but that different placement options had little to no effect on reading performance, even if participants had different preferences.","Pascal Goffin","pascal.goffin@inria.fr","1.

This technique aims at enabling users to point towards an object, visualize its current state and select a desired functionality as well. To achieve this: 1) we present a new remote control that contains a pico-projector and a slider; 2) we introduce a visualization technique that allows users to locate and control objects kept in adjacent rooms, by using their spatial memories. We further present a few example applications that convey the possibilities of this technique.","Gilles Bailly","gilles.bailly@telecom-paristech.fr ","1. Andrade, J., Meudell, P.

We describe a workflow which allows the user to browse live entities associated with 65 million articles. In the on-line interface, each query leads to a specific network representation of the most prevailing entities: topics (words), authors, journals and Dewey decimal classes linked to the set of terms in the query. This network represents the context of a query. Each of the network nodes is clickable: by clicking through, a user traverses a large space of articles along dimensions of authors, journals, Dewey classes and words simultaneously. We present different use cases of such an interface. This paper provides a link between the quest for maps of science and on-going debates in HCI about the use of interactive information visualisation to empower users in their search.

Similar to Google Cardboard, the headset uses a smartphone to provide the compute power, connectivity and display.  Unlike Google Cardboard, our headset does not block the user’s view of the world and is therefore suitable for AR applications.  The headset uses the Pepper’s Ghost illusion to display images from the phone’s screen via a transparent sheet located in front of the user’s eyes.  During a pilot study, we confirmed that the headset is effective in settings with low to medium levels of ambient illumination: in these conditions we demonstrated the effectiveness of using a mobile phone’s standard screen brightness settings to present a range of photos, 3D images, short texts and shapes.","Daniela De Angeli","dada21@bath.ac.uk"," \ WARNING: Reference 10 is very long.

An evaluation of CereProc's MyMyRadio is presented as a case study to highlight the potential and challenges of an interactive radio approach: the difficulty of transitioning between passive and active modes of interaction, and the challenge of designing such services. The evaluation showed: 1) A higher workload for MyMyRadio for active tasks compared to default applications (e.g. Facebook app); 2) No significant difference in workload for passive tasks (e.g. listening to audio rendered RSS updates vs Browser app); 3) A higher workload when listening to music within MyMyRadio vs iTunes; and 4) A preference for RSS feed content compared to content from social media.

This information is already abundant and available via Online Social Media. The missing link is a rigorous, anonymized and open source artefact that gives feedback to stakeholders and constituents. To address this, BeWell, an unobtrusive, low latency multi-resolution measurement for the observation, analysis and modelling of community dynamics, is proposed. To assess communal well-being, 42 Facebook pages of a large public university in Germany are analyzed with a dictionary-based text analytics program, LIWC. We establish the baseline of emotive discourse across the sample, and detect significant campus-wide events in this proof of concept implementation, then discuss future iterations including a community dashboard and a participatory management plan.

As regular crowdsourcing, friendsourcing requesters needs to incentivize potential workers (i.e., friends) to actually engage and complete the requested tasks. However, it is unclear how to effectively motivate friendsourcing workers and what incentives, which may include both social and monetary ones, are considered feasible in friendsourcing, especially by taking social relations between requesters and workers as part of the calculation. In an exploratory study, we asked participants to report their estimations of feasible payment as a requester, and reward as a worker in friendsourcing. We compare the estimated costs of friendsourcing to regular crowdsourcing, and find that there exists a gap between requesters’ and workers’ expected costs. Individuals would like to pay more as a requester, and expect to receive less as a worker in friendsourcing. Consideration of social transaction and relationship maintenance is involved. We discuss the implications for designing friendsourcing systems.","Joey Chiao-Yin Hsiao","joeycyhsiao@gmail.com","1. Bernstein, M. S., Little, G., Miller, R. C., Hartmann, B., Ackerman, M.

However, due to their limited size, touch interaction can be cumbersome. Although alternative input modalities such as speech input could be used, these can also introduce other issues regarding privacy or ease of use. Consequently, HCI researchers have been exploring novel input techniques for smartwatches. In this paper, we introduce WatchMe, a smartwatch application that uses the smartwatch camera and image processing techniques to allow for providing input on a drawing canvas composed of everyday objects and surfaces. We rely on a cloud OCR engine to retrieve text from captured images. Combining these characteristics, we illustrate some scenarios in which WatchMe could be used, such as a novel method for two-factor authentication.","Jo Vermeulen","j.vermeulen@cs.bham.ac.uk","1.

Here, we present results from an exploratory study of hand orientation and occlusion among American primary school students using a touch-screen tablet device. We investigated hand orientations, amount of occlusion, and the effects of tablet tilt angle (flat or tilted) on students preferred hand orientations when using a touch-screen tablet device. From 18 interviews with 5th–7th grade students using interactive science simulations, we found five common hand orientations corresponding to a range from high to low occlusion. Tablet tilt angle considerably impacted students preferred hand orientations. Based on these results, we suggest that encouraging students to work on tablets with a moderate tilt angle (30-45 degrees), rather than lying flat on a table, could significantly decrease occlusion and increase the effectiveness of touch-screen tablet devices for learning.","Emily B.

Despite this, more research is needed to understand what makes these teams effective. One such topic not fully explored is the formation of subgroups in teams that work with robots. We conducted a pilot study to explore this topic. The study examined 15 teams of 2 people, each team member working with a robot to accomplish a team task. Results of the pilot study showed that subgroups formed between humans and their robots were negatively correlated with various team outcomes. Although our results are preliminary, we believe our findings can initiate future research on the topic of subgroup formation in teams working with robots.","Sangseok You","sangyou@umich.edu","1.

In this paper, we report intermediate results from a sample of 236 European students aged between 18 and 34. 76% of our participants are keen to preserve their photos for future generations, but far fewer report photo management practices that support preservation.

However, inhabitants of such smart environments keep having problems understanding, administering, troubleshooting, and deriving benefits from the technologies employed in their homes. By synthesizing a broad body of research on end-user programming in smart homes with observations of commercial products and our own experiences, we provide a set of guidelines for designers of future interfaces and tools. Stemming from them, we present the design and the initial evaluation of HomeRules, a mobile and tangible application for end-user programming in smart homes.","Luigi De Russis","luigi.derussis@polito.it","1.

However, it has been mostly used for screen-based interaction with static information. In this paper, we propose a concept of gaze-based interaction that augments the physical world with social information. We demonstrate this interaction in a shopping scenario. In-store shopping is a setting where social information can augment the physical environment to better support a user’s purchase decision. Based on the user’s ocular point, we project the following information on the product and its surrounding surface: collective in-store gazes and purchase data, product comparison information, animation expressing ingredient of product, and online social comments. This paper presents the design of the system, the results and discussion of an informal user study, and future work.","Mirae Kim","miraekim@andrew.cmu.edu","1. Black, D., Clemmensen, N.

The experimental results confirmed that recommendation effects vary according to agent appearance. Furthermore, we obtained a partial order ranking of the agent types, representing the effectiveness of their recommendations.

Motivational factors were studied through contextual interviews, an adapted cultural probe activity and a survey with a group of young adults currently active in sports. From our preliminary findings we determine that staying healthy, achieving specific goals and socialising represent key motivational factors for young adults to be active in sports, but also, that exercise is not considered a high priority in their daily lives. A link between the motivation of achieving specific goals and a technology to measure and track activities was established. The study concludes with three implications for the design of technology to motivate young adults to participate in sports.","Stephen Snow","steve.snow@qut.edu.au","1.

This bridges the gap between differently sized touch screen devices, and enables a novel and mobile form of split screen touch interaction that deviates from traditional rectangular form.  We show how a flexible mobile device with unrestricted folding can create more realistic and augmented experiences: building on people’s existing abilities to manipulate real world objects.  We demonstrate this with shape enhanced “Wizard of Oz” demo applications including a book, online shopping, a board game, street navigation, and a dynamic browser.  Our prototype is tracked with a Kinect and uses a projector for visual output.  In the future, we envision devices like Projectagami to be self-contained and extended to 3D form.","Dominique Tan","dt1804@my.bristol.ac.uk","WARNING: Reference 9 is very long.

This work in progress presents GNomon, a framework based on the NOMON interaction modality which enables the creation of dynamic, entertaining and complex one-switch video games for children with severe motor disabilities. The framework was designed in close collaboration with a team of speech therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists from one of the Local Health Agencies in Turin, Italy.

We learned that there is a sense of “powerlessness” in the traditional embroidery industry. The sense of “powerlessness” comes from not only the operators themselves but also the general mentality in Taiwan. Drawing on this phenomenon, we designed interactive artifacts with sounds, trying to stimulate peoples’ existing imagination on cultural consciousness. Until now, we have completed a prototype, which integrates embroidery and interactive audio. Finally, we will use conductive thread as our design material to create our final artifact and hold an exhibition to demonstrate it, encouraging people to make reflection and discourse upon this issue. \ ","Yu-Shin Wang","shin38@hotmail.com.tw","[1] Dunne, A., and Raby.

The app provides a personal flu risk bar that rises when the user is near someone with flu-like symptoms and drops when the user finishes one of the suggested flu-preventive behaviors. Preliminary results show that participants favored the personal flu risk bar design. Participants had positive experiences when their personal risk bars dropped. They were motivated to initiate flu-preventive behaviors when their personal risk bars rose. Our next step includes studying reward strategies, users’ motivations to share personal health information, and building a more accurate model of flu risk. ","Na Li","nali01@fas.harvard.edu","1.

Storytelling is a natural way to introduce the basic concepts behind object-oriented programming. To convey object-oriented programming concepts to children, such as object, attribute and etc., we present a new tangible programming tool --TanProStory, for children in 1-3 grades. Children can tell a story by arranging programming blocks to initialize a character and construct a program controlling its action. TanProStory consists of three parts: Programming blocks, Animation Game and Sensor input module. Programming blocks in TanProStory are surface-sensitive, i.e. only the command on the top surface can be detected.  We conducted a preliminary user study and analyzed the results, which can guide a better design of TanProStory.","Danli Wang","danliwang2009@gmail.com"," \ 1. Burke, Q, and Kafai Y.B.

We find it difficult, however, to actively monitor ourselves and commit to making these breaks in the middle of studying or working. The work presented in this paper proposes a motivational smartphone application that connects to a sensor-equipped seat device to track sitting behavior. The application’s distinguishing feature is its interactive virtual pet, which acts as a motivational factor to promote healthier sitting habits. The application analyzes sensor readings from the seat device and prompts users with their virtual pet to take physical action. Our prototype is the outcome of a thorough investigation of user needs.","Deedee Min","ddmin88@gmail.com","1. 3D Incorporated. (2013).

This paper outlines our work towards designing more user centred technology for individual and household budgeting. Based on an ethnographically informed study with 15 participants, we highlight a misalignment between people’s actual budgeting practices and those supported by off-the-shelf budgeting aids. In addressing this misalignment we outline three tenets that may be incorporated into future work in this area. These include (1) catering for the different phases of engagement with technology; (2) catering for the practices of hiding and limiting access to money, and; (3) integrating materiality into technical solutions.","Stephen Snow","steve.snow@qut.edu.au","1.

This paper describes a case of a Japanese AI journal’s cover design that evoked a huge public and academic discussion of its ethical and social implications in December 2013. The case implies a lack of dialogue and collaboration between the AI community and researchers in social sciences and humanities that may, in the long term, have a negative impact on the public perception of AI research. Although this is a case study in Japan, we expect that the case will serve as a warning for HCI researchers about the importance of being conscious about social and ethical research perspectives.","Arisa Ema","a.ema22@gmail.com","1.

In this paper we envision a system architecture where visually impaired people use GPS-enabled mobile computing devices to easily reserve and access taxi services. Specifically, as the first step in designing such a system, we try to understand the preferred interaction interface requirements of the visually impaired population using a set of interviews conducted over 28 visually impaired participants. Our results show that the smartphone usage rate of our interview participants is ∼60%; thus, smartphone-based applications should not be considered as the “everyone-will-use-platform” when interacting with the visually impaired. Results from an extensive set of questions reveal that interaction interfaces in the form of key chains and wrist watches can also be effective for various interactive applications.","JeongGil Ko","jeonggil.ko@gmail.com","1.

The proposed approach is based on the analysis of the recorded eye movements via what is called behavioral scores. These easy-to-compute scores can be obtained immediately after a calibration procedure, via processing of such basic eye movements as fixations and saccades extracted from the raw eye positional data recorded by an eye tracker. The results, based on the data from 36 volunteers indicate that one of the behavioral scores, Fixational Qualitative Score, is more sensitive to the onset of eye fatigue than already established methods based on saccadic characteristics only.

We discuss how the SynKu application enables us to explore how algorithms help to change and legitimate the reconstruction of sensory phenomena across self-tracking platforms.","Daniela K.

We explore the use of vibrotactile (VT) feedback for social and interpersonal communication on embedded systems, particularly in a mobile context. We propose an architecture that supports compact packet communication between devices and triggers expressive VT patterns in a typical messenger application. We present a communication API, haptic vocabularies, and an interface for receiving and authoring haptic messages. Finally, we conclude with an informal survey for using haptics in a social setting.","Ali Israr","israr@disneyresearch.com","[1] http://www.immersion.com \  \ [2] Bailenson, J.N., Yee, N., Brave, S., Merget, D. and Koslow, D.

The most common way of interacting with smartwatches is either touching a screen or pressing buttons on the sides. However, such techniques require using both hands. We propose glance awareness and active gaze interaction as alternative techniques to interact with smartwatches. We will describe an experiment conducted to understand the user preferences for visual and haptic feedback on a “glance” at the wristwatch. Following the glance, the users interacted with the watch using gaze gestures. Our results showed that user preferences differed depending on the complexity of the interaction. No clear preference emerged for complex interaction. For simple interaction, haptics was the preferred glance feedback modality. ","Deepak Akkil","deepak.akkil@uta.fi","1.

However, the finger touch interface is considered as not accurate compared with pen-based interface. One of the main reasons is that the visual feedback of the finger touch is occluded because of the size of fingertip. It has made difficult for perceiving and correcting errors. We propose to utilize another modality to provide information on occluded area. Spatial information on visual channel is transformed to temporal and frequency information on another modality. We use sound modality to illustrate the proposed trans-modality. Results show that performance with additional modality is better for drawing where the visual information is important than only with the visual feedback.","BoYu Gao","boycegao@gmail.com","1.

We report a work-in-progress case from one company as an example of how company-wide experience goals can be defined for enabling consistent experience in all touch points.

We present a prototype called Lock n' LoL, an app that allows co-located users to lock their smartphones and limit their usage by enforcing users to ask for explicit use permission. From our preliminary study, we designed two modes to deal with the dynamics of smartphone use during the co-located social interactions: (1) socializing mode (i.e., locking \ smartphones to limit usage together) and (2) temporary use mode (i.e., requesting/granting temporary smartphone use). We conducted a pilot study (n = 20) with our working prototype, and the results documented the helpfulness of Lock n' LoL when used in socializing.","Minsam Ko","msko@kaist.ac.kr","1. Ames, M. G.

In particular, a clear  \ understanding of scratching behaviors can be difficult  \ for young children or for those who engage in nocturnal  \ itching while sleeping. In this work, we design a  \ prototype system with two smartwatches which recognize  \ scratching motions and validate the results using an  \ infrared camera to provide the ground truth. We classify  \ scratching motions with the C4.5 algorithm and analyze  \ the data to understand the scratch patterns and to  \ validate our system.

Beside the fact that music can be experienced as motivating or rewarding, it is mainly associated with leisure time. Thus, consuming music in work settings is often perceived critically.  \ In this paper, we present research that explores how the positive `side effects' of music can be combined in design with meaningful auditive navigation suggestions to improve the experience of employees in strictly constrained workplaces.

The system measures the physical movement of the learner using a Kinect sensor, and provides a sense of immersion in the paleontological environment by adapting the surroundings according to these movements. As the first stage of this project, we have developed a prototype system that allows learners to experience the paleontological environment. Here, we evaluate the operability of the system, degree of learning support, and sense of immersion for primary schoolchildren.

A prototype system has been developed to be compatible with existing email clients and to deliver emails at higher estimated interruptibility times, especially at application switching moments that are considered as breakpoints in PC tasks. Trial use by eight participants in ordinary working environments suggested that email notifications were delivered at moments with lower levels of operation activity and the feelings of hindrance were decreased. Further study is to be conducted to investigate the effect of automatic email delivery mediation on the cognitive cost and work efficiency.","Yasumasa Kobayashi","50014646116@st.tuat.ac.jp","1.

We describe system design from physical space to software implementation and share our findings from 4 years of deployment. Since the first prototype was deployed at a national children’s library headquartered in Korea, the accumulated number of young visitors reached 15000 and 20 additional children’s libraries have installed the system. Our results demonstrate that mixed reality applications create a pleasant and engaging user experience for young children combined with storytelling. ","Seokbin Kang","sean.kang84@gmail.com","1.

The Disney method is based on three roles aiming at helping groups to consider different views on a topic. As it is difficult for novices to comply with the requirements of this technique, we developed an interactive system supporting groups using this method. Each group member is provided with a tablet to enter ideas and choose the role in which a contribution is made, represented by different colors. We conducted a user study with eight groups and compared two versions: a baseline without additional support and a version with an additional feedback mechanism providing functional feedback about the distribution of the roles. Our main contributions are: (1) a system using feedback to support the Disney method and (2) results indicating that functional feedback can help modest group members to engage more in the group process.","Sarah Tausch","sarah.tausch@ifi.lmu.de","1.

However, many projects fail to achieve their goals. Understanding donor behavior is essential to make fundraising successful. In this paper, we analyze donor behavior by collecting large-scale data from HAPPYBEAN, the largest crowdfunding platform for non-profits in Korea. In this study, we classified donors into five groups and analyzed donor behavior based on the following criteria, i.e., activeness, self-expression, and topical interests. We found that donors who contribute small amount of money and only a few times are critical for the projects' success. Our findings produce insights about donor behavior in crowdfunding for non-profits.","Aejin Song","aejin.song@kaist.ac.kr","1.

We developed an interactive application that communicated health-related correlations on a set of Sifteo displays, and compared it to a traditional screen-based graphical interface conveying identical information. Our user experience and insight analysis study showed that the tangible interface allowed for more personal, reflective insights, whereas the graphical user interface was considered more efficient in time. These findings were confirmed during an in-the-wild observation study in a hospital waiting room. We therefore formulated a set of design implications for the future interaction design of casual, tangible visualizations on small screens.","Sandy Claes","sandy.claes@gmail.com","1.

In order to contribute to the further validation and meaningful application of the PENS and GEQ we examined the underlying factorial structure of both questionnaires. Four hundred and forty-seven participants played two different games and rated them on a set of various variables including the PENS and GEQ. Consistent with previous research we gained additional insight into optimization of both measurements. While the factor structure of the PENS appears to be consistent and invariant across two different games, the GEQ reveals weaknesses in fulfilling these requirements.

For example, the visibility of wearable devices to other people (e.g. a wearable display) could augment the wearer’s appearance by displaying public and socially relevant information about them. Such information could increase nearby people’s awareness of the wearer, thus serve as tickets-to-talk and, ideally, enhance their first encounters. We present the design of CueSense, a wearable displays that shows textual content from the wearer’s social media profiles, determined by the level of proximity to another user and match-making between their contents. We report the findings from a preliminary user study with 18 participants, followed by discussion as well as ideas for future research and further refinement of the concept.

To improve the virtual keyboards, we focus on two observations. First, all alphabetic keys are already allocated to each finger of skilled typists. Second, non-touching fingers move in correlation with a touching finger because of the intrinsic structure of the human hand. Based on the first observation, we suggested a new virtual keyboard that restricts each finger to enter the pre-allocated keys only. Then, we statistically proved the second observation in our experiment. Through this experiment, we found the significant correlations between a touching and some of the other non-touching fingers. Finally, we discussed how these correlations can help to improve the performance of the virtual keyboards.","Daewoong Choi","syddas@korea.ac.kr","1. Findlater, L., Wobbrock, J.

However, the method in which particular persuasive design principles are chosen over others remains unclear. Meanwhile, the use of socio-ecological model has been widely utilized in clinical research, as a basis to understand the factors in the entire ecological system that influences behavioural patterns. Because persuasive technology aims to change the behaviour and attitudes of users, we believe that the use of socio-ecological model would be beneficial to inform the design of persuasive applications. Accordingly, in this paper, we attempt to demonstrate the mapping of the socio-ecological factors and persuasive design principles by conducting interviews and expert reviews. Based on our approach, 12 socio-ecological factors that influence physical activity behaviour, and corresponding relevant persuasive design principles to deal with these factors, are identified.

Positive psychology, and recently also HCI, makes use of a hedonia/ eudaimonia distinction. Hedonia is understood as providing enjoyable experiences, whereas eudaimonia is associated with meaningful experiences. However, it is not clear how eudaimonia manifests in the HCI context. The aim of this explorative study is to provide empirical evidence for eudaimonia in HCI and outline what characterizes hedonic and eudaimonic user experiences. Results indicate that hedonic and eudaimonic user experiences often seem to occur at the same time. Preliminary analysis of user narratives show rich data and experiences with a huge range of different devices are described.

In this paper we review the existing literature on one type of wearable – smartwatches – and extend their definition, in addition to highlighting the need to understand users’ everyday appropriation of these technologies. We present initial findings from an on going interview study with ten early adopters that is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to investigate why and how people use smartwatches in real life. We describe everyday use of smartwatches, highlight the added value seen by users, and identify the limitations to mass adoption as expressed by current users.","Marta Cecchinato","marta.cecchinato.13@ucl.ac.uk","1.

However, if a local user changes the viewpoint of a shared live video while a remote user is drawing an annotation, the annotation is projected and  drawn at wrong place. Prior work suggested manually freezing the video while annotating to solve the issue, but this needs additional user input. We introduce a solution that automatically freezes the video, and present the results of a user study comparing it with manual freeze and no freeze conditions. Auto-freeze was most preferred by both remote and local participants who felt it best solved the issue of annotations appearing in the wrong place. With auto-freeze, remote users were able to draw annotations quicker, while the local users were able to understand the annotations clearer.","Seungwon Kim","seungwon.kim@pg.canterbury.ac.nz","1.

Human factors—such as cognitive workload and limited attentional capacity—have been shown to affect operators’ ability to detect critical incidents. The current standard surveillance environment comprises a large screen layout that simultaneously displays multiple camera feeds. Although having access to all sources of information at once seems intuitively appealing, there is ample evidence to suggest that it can, in fact, lead to poor detection performance.  We propose a design solution that is based on principles grounded in cognitive psychology and user experience design. One key objective is to test empirically whether an atypical design pattern that is consistent with serial cognitive processes induces better performance than the current standard surveillance environment. Three variations of the alternative display pattern will be tested by comparing their effects on detection performance within a surveillance microworld.

Our prototype device consists of a showerhead with a mechanical switch, a microcontroller, a motor driver, a DC motor and a cam that is connected to mechanical switch on the showerhead. We conducted an experiment to evaluate the performance of the device, namely bandwidth, latency and operating volume, and showed that the device has sufficient capacity for an enriching music experience, with up to 2100 beats per minute and around 54 dBA operating volume.","Keisuke Hoshino","hoshi@kaji-lab.jp","[1]	Lemmens, P., Crompvoets, F., Brokken, D., Eerenbeemd, J.and Vries, G.

Such understanding can be explored to inform the design and development of personal informatics systems, aimed to support reflection and increased self-awareness. We describe a diary study with six participants and discuss initial findings showing the qualities of daily meaningful events, the value of different types of cues and their distinct contents for supporting episodic recall.

However the thrill of the tale is often lost and the intimacy diluted when separated families have to resort to the flatness of a video-call or mobile app to share a bedtime story with their loved one. This project is setting out to create a physical story portal, a magical object which uses technologies to link teller and listener through sound, light and touch to help bridge this gap when families are separated. \  \ While the development of the InTouch reading system is still in the preliminary stages, a prototype handheld device has been created to allow adults and children to share touch-based messages during story time. It has been trialled with several families in the lab, and the initial results have pointed to both guidance and design considerations that should be taken into account for such a system to be successfully deployed.","Elaine Massung","elaine.massung@bristol.ac.uk","1.

In order to maintain harmonious view and satisfactory experience, the relationship between the information and transparency needs to be considered. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate different levels of transparency for determining their appropriateness with regard to user’s proximity. Two user studies show that 25% transparency is more satisfactory in closer proximity while 50% transparency offers more harmonious view in a distant context. Our findings on satisfactory transparency can be applied to a basis of further investigation for public transparent displays, especially in a shop context.","Heesun Kim","090615@kist.re.kr","1.

Previous work indicates that physical navigation enables a deeper engagement with the data set. In particular, the visibility of detailed data subsets on large screens supports the user's work and understanding of large data. In contrast to previous work we explore how users' performance scales with an increasing amount of large display space when working with text documents. In a controlled experiment, we determine participants' performance when searching for titles and images in large text documents using one to six 50"" 4K monitors.

When we don't know which bus to take, how to prepare plantains, or how to use a certain app, we ask a nearby peer. If the right peer is not around, we can use a mobile device to connect to a remote peer. To get the desired answer, though, we need to find the right person, and have the right affordances to send and receive the relevant information. In this paper, we define a class of micro-presence systems for just-in-time micro-interactions with remote companions, and explore dimensions of the design space. Informed by theories of contextual memory and situated learning, we present TagAlong, a micro-presence system conceived for learning a second language in context with help from a remote native speaker. TagAlong uses a connected head-mounted camera and head-up display device to share images of the wearer's visual context with remote peers. The remote companion can convey knowledge using these images as a point of reference-- images are sampled, annotated and then sent back to the wearer in real time. We report on a quantitative experiment to determine the effectiveness of using visual cues that involve spatial and photographic elements as a means of “pointing” at things to draw the wearer's attention to them.","Scott Greenwald","scottgwald@gmail.com","1.

Recent research involving technology to help people quit smoking has had limited success. Personal face-to-face counseling has historically proven the most successful and effective means to help people quit, but most people are reluctant or too busy to attend counseling sessions. As a potential solution to this problem, we explore providing personal counseling to users via their mobile phones. The advice, written by experts, is based on data about the user and their actual smoking habits collected through smart phones. From a prototype deployment with users in real life context, we found that this type of personal counseling is influential in changing peoples’ smoking behaviors for the better. In addition, being made aware of actual smoking habits helps people form strategies that improve their ability to quit.","Jesper Kjeldskov","jesper@cs.aau.dk","1. Abroms, L.

The play environment fulfills a ‘sport over the distance’ them via the attempt to mimic the real world ball-passing exercise (or rehabilitation sessions) except that the players can be miles away from each other, and they interact without a physical ball. Moreover, our system allows each player to see the other two and their physical environment respectively, which is a combination of the physical world where players are situated and the virtual world where they play with each other. Kinect sensors are used to map players’ action into a virtual world including the passing of the virtual ball. The system prototype was tested with two groups of players; a revised version was pilot tested with 48 players and lead to the final version of the system. Pilot testing results were encouraging in that players reported collective fun and increased social bonding. Meanwhile, player anonymity increased players’ willingness to play the virtual-ball game with a stranger, which indicates that the game might be more suitable for those with less social fluency.","Tiffany Y.

In the tendering process a procuring organization defines usability requirements, evaluation procedures and selection criteria, while IT vendors try and build and propose solutions that best fulfill these requirements. Existing usability research has instructed the procuring organizations on how usability should be included in the request for proposals, in order to ensure the usability of the selected system. However, the IT vendor perspective on request for proposals and related usability work during the tendering process remain unexplored. This paper grasps the issue with an empirical study on large-scale IT procurement. The preliminary findings give practical advice to vendors planning usability work and buyers writing request for proposals.","Kimmo Tarkkanen","kimmo.tarkkanen@utu.fi","1. Baskerville, Richard L.

We present CourseMIRROR (Mobile In-situ Reflections and Review with Optimized Rubrics), a mobile system that prompts students' self-reflection and in-situ feedback to enhance the interactions. CourseMIRROR uses automatic text summarization techniques to aggregate students' feedback and present the most significant ones to both the instructors and the students to help them understand both difficulties and misunderstandings encountered. In two semester-long pilot deployments involving 20 participants, we received positive feedback from both students and instructors. We highlight major findings as well as the lessons learned.

In this paper, we focus on the psychological mechanisms on error detection. We conceptualize working memory (WM) as a critical cognitive component in error detection and two studies were carried out to investigate the effects of WM load and capacity on error detection performance and the detection of different error types. Study I found a significant interaction effect of WM load × capacity: low WM capacity participants performed significantly worse in higher WM load condition, however, high WM capacity participants’ performances were unaffected by higher WM load. Study II employed think-aloud technique to gain insights into detectable error types and generated novel predictions about the effect of WM demands on detecting different errors. These predictions allow for a new research direction in error detection.","Sze-yuen Yau","szeyuenyau@LN.hk","1.	Barchard, K.A. and L.A.

Our approach is based on the felt qualities of movement, and provides a shared experience, vocabulary for self-expression, and appreciation for movement as a design material for interaction design practitioners. We present a workshop, where after movement sessions, interactive sketches were generated and implemented by motion tracking. Subsequently, we have investigated whether or not these activities guided the participants from the prevailing notion of command/control in embodied interaction towards experiences related to the felt qualities of movement. While in idea generation, our approach has provided a better foundation for participants, compared to the approaches that focus only on technologies, this effect wore off and final implementations focused on command & control. We currently experiment with new tools and techniques, integrating material interactions into the process.","Cumhur Erkut","cer@create.aau.dk","[1]	Erkut, C., Dahl, S., and Triantafyllidis, G.

This research was conducted due to the difficulty of expressing the emotions in driving contexts. At first, throughout driver observation and survey it was found that existing interface in car is not enough to express drivers’ emotion to other drivers. Also most representative emotions drivers want to express while driving were identified, which were made into emoticons. Interactive prototypes which display emoticons were installed in the front and back of vehicles so that drivers can express their emotions while driving. Experiments were conducted to verify whether drivers’ stress was reduced when the prototype was installed in the vehicle, thereby enabling them to share their feelings with other drivers. The results showed that stress was indeed reduced in drivers compared to their original state.","Haechan Kim","kimhaechan@kaist.ac.kr","1. Forgas, J. P. (1995).

Photos and keywords are often used to describe color, texture, and airiness of products. However consumer photos are usually taken under uncontrolled realistic imaging conditions, whereas keywords are fuzzy and highly subjective. Palette leverages active spectrophotometry approach that involves synchronized illumination to measure the reflection and transmission properties of a material as a function of wavelength. We use a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) sensor equipped camera to capture visible light and near-infrared light intensity. We show that by analyzing the obtained light spectrum, we are able to provide a metric to represent material color and airiness. In this paper, we describe the details in principle of operation and proof-of-concept prototype implementation, as well as reporting results of our analysis using 4 types of garments. To the best of our knowledge, Palette is the first work to exploit spectrophotometry to represent garment color, texture, and airiness; as an effort to enrich user experience in online shopping.","Shogo YAMASHITA","shogo.yamashita325@gmail.com","1.

However being investigated since decades, TUIs still play a marginal role compared to other UI paradigms. This is at least partially because TUIs often involve complex hardware elements, which make prototyping and production in quantities difficult and expensive. In this paper we present our work towards paper TUIs (pTUIs) -- easily makeable interactive TUIs using laser-cut paper, brass fasteners, metal bands, mirror foils, and touch screen devices as platform. Through three examples we highlight the flexibility of the approach. We rebuilt the seminal work URP to show that pTUIs can replicate existing TUIs in DIY manufacturing. We implemented tangible Pong being controlled by paper rackets to show that pTUIs can be used in highly interactive systems. Finally, we manufactured an interactive Christmas card and distributed it to 300 recipients by mail to show that pTUIs can be used as apparatus to explore how pTUIs are used outside the lab in real life.","Katrin Wolf","Stefan Schneegass","1.

Unlike self-monitoring applications, users of self-diagnosis applications are non-patients - people who do not have the explicit awareness of their potential diseases or health problems. It is not clear how to incentivize usage, how to best present results, and how to sustain habit formation for periodic long-term use. We conduct an exploratory case study to investigate the special design challenges of such systems. From our findings, we recommend self-diagnosis applications should: 1) be designed with less perceived harmfulness; 2) state the risk of diagnosed disease explicitly; 3) show the implicit diagnosis result with percentage; and 4) present the rationale behind the diagnosis result.

This study aims to explore how automation in energy conservation system should be designed from a new perspective: comfort-energy trade-off. Scenario-based survey was conducted with 106 participants. Results showed that monitored control (high level of automation) was most satisfied in energy-saving-motivated control scenario and consensual control (low level of automation) was most satisfied in comfort-motivated control scenario. Users perceived the same sense of control in consensual control and monitored control as in manual control (no automation) in most scenarios. Thus, the results indicated that automatic environment control should not always be the same, but adaptively designed in accordance with specific comfort-energy trade-off situations, considering different control scenario, personal requirement and culture.

We highlight the complexity of end-users’ location constraints, especially for shared local search scenarios, i.e. scenarios involving others. Even in a relatively mundane scenario, we demonstrate significant gaps in the handling of place requirements in existing location-based services as compared to identified user requirements.

Benefits accrue to participants in online health support groups, but few individuals contribute even once. Those with higher levels of AHSE have been shown to persist longer and with more effort in online groups, and AHSE levels can be increased in those not demonstrating it. However, determining levels of AHSE requires direct intervention in groups. This tool for assessing AHSE supports non-invasive measurement through behavior patterns and text analysis.","Elisabeth Joyce","ejoyce@edinboro.edu","1. Bandura, A.

The recovery of such victims, includes psycho-motor therapies to reduce neuromuscular aftermaths, such as phantom limb pain (PLP). Therefore, improving rehabilitation strategies can potentially have a large positive impact in the recovery outcomes for long-term treatments. ViLimbs is a Virtual-Reality-based (VR) system aimed at enhancing classical mirror therapy for amputees using an immersive video-wall that renders the patient himself with a superimposed virtual limb. The patient-virtual-limb interaction is achieved by means of brain computer interfaces (BCI) and myoelectric signals read from the remaining part of the limb. Thus, voluntary movements get naturally transferred from patients to virtual limbs. Last but not least, patients sense of ownership over an alien virtual limb is enhanced through multisensory feedback (cardio-visual), which tends to lessen rehabilitation times.","Esteban Correa-Agudelo","maurosc3ner@gmail.com","1.

Technology such as social robots becomes a likely solution for providing care. Realism plays an important role in how these social robots are perceived. We designed Polygon, a robot with a minimal amount of realism to explore whether it is possible to yield acceptable design opportunities with minimal means. This study evaluated 3 focus groups (N=34, 23 patients diagnosed with acquired brain injury (ABI), 11 healthcare professionals). Results indicate that patients with ABI are struggling with their independence and loneliness. Additionally, social robots designed with a minimal approach to realism could play a role as acceptable solutions for these patients.","Robert A. Paauwe","r.a.paauwe@vu.nl","1.

Despite the ease with which hobbyists, educators and researchers can construct working circuits, a major limitation of prototyping with conductive ink is the difficulty of altering a design which has already been printed, and in particular removing areas of ink. In this paper we present Circuit Eraser, a simple yet effective tool which enables users to ‘delete’ existing conductive patterns. Through experimentation we have found an effective combination of materials which result in the removal of only the thin surface layer composed of ink particles, with minimal damage to the surface coating of the paper. This important characteristic ensures it is possible to re-apply conductive ink as part of an on-going design iteration. In addition to a lab-based evaluation of our Circuit Eraser which we present here, we have also used our technique in several practical applications and we illustrate one of these, namely the iterative design of a radio-frequency antenna.","Koya Narumi","narumi@akg.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp","1.

While these devices continue to improve, there is, as yet, no device that affords six degrees of freedom (6-DoF) control and directional haptic feedback. We present The Cage, a 6-DoF controller for piloting an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The Cage is comprised of a handle suspended by eight lines, each coupled to a vertex, within a physical cuboid cage. Each line in turn is connected to a stepper motor, allowing the pilot to move and rotate the handle freely to control the UAV whilst obtaining accurate directional force feedback. This feedback can both subtly and absolutely constrain the control of the UAV to within the flight area thus preventing the pilot from hazard collisions. We define 4 modes of force feedback and a range of application areas.

This is necessary to develop distributed situational awareness and facilitate collaboration. Currently, information exchange is mainly based on oral communication. Oral communication can be misunderstood or ambiguous. This paper reports on different scenarios from the security domain in which augmented reality (AR) techniques are used to support information exchange.

The prototype follows a seamless and always-on approach requiring minimal changes to the Gmail user interface and task flow. Many studies have pointed out problems with email security usability, but they usually take an adversarial context as reference. The focus of this work is on peacetime information disclosure with service providers when adopting third party web applications. This context is a remarkable characteristic in the trending Bring-Your-Own-Application phenomenon and raises many privacy and confidentiality concerns. Although users could successful benefit from the security approach and protect their messages without much extra work, many long-term adoption obstacles were detected in informal user observations.","Paulo Hecht","paulo.hecht@dc.ufscar.br","1.

Computer mouse motion streams and users’ skin conductance signals, acquired via an in-house developed computer mouse, and users’ feedback were investigated as reactions to task difficulty raising events. A classification algorithm was developed, producing real-time user models of user hesitation states.

The concept offers means for proximity-based playful social interaction, mediated by collaboratively created stories consisting of several clips. We present a preliminary user study to gather early feedback on the concept and to identify main hindrances. Our analysis shows promising results: the concept is considered as fun and playful, and there is high interest to follow how the challenges proceed.

Those who are unable to benefit from this activity, such as the mentally and physically disabled are less prone to be exposed to the leisure. Due to simple technical setups, the projects presented here can be placed anywhere at the ease of the user. The pilot studies with target populations indicate that calming tangible interaction with plants can evoke mindfulness in a similar way to gardening related experiences.","Jinsil Hwaryoung Seo","hwaryoung@tamu.edu","1.

While fitness tracking systems have advanced into on-body sensing modalities, the process of data reporting and intervention is still largely done through mobile and web applications, using traditional methods of data visualization such as graphs and charts. This has resulted in a disconnect between data and its context.

We combine physical exploration and interactive entertainment by providing real-time audio and light feedback without the need to be in front of a screen. In contrast with today’s computer, video and smartphone games, our system has the potential to enhance children’s physical, social and outdoor play.

As a first step towards moderating these types of problematic smartphone usage, we conducted an exploratory study on the efficacy of using a decisional balancing exercise. The exercise is designed to consider a user’s motivation level in terms of intention and readiness to change his/her behavior. Despite a short trial period and small sample size, our results show that users who participated in the decisional balancing exercise were more likely to be receptive to their own intervention methods designed to moderate their smartphone use than those who did not participate. Thus, the results suggest that employing decisional balance exercise has the potential to moderate problematic smartphone usage.","Hancheol Park","hancheol.park@kaist.ac.kr","1. Cunningham, J.

To identify the proper approach of skeuomorphism we articulated two factors such as degree of realism and level abstraction. We employed “call”, “contact”, and “camera” icons and created eight alternatives, four degrees of realism by two levels of abstraction for each. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 30 Korean elderly and asked about their preference and understandability depending on how the app icons are visualized. A conjoint analysis revealed that the degree of realism is more important for having an aesthetic satisfaction, whereas the abstraction level is more relevant for better understanding the function of an icon. Overall, the degree of realism is positively correlated with both preference and understandability. Moreover a direct metaphoric icon has an advantage to appeal more and to inform more efficiently, particularly for female or novice elderly users. ","Hyeon-Jeong Suk","h.j.suk@kaist.ac.kr","[1]   C.

Metaphors are created allowing their characters to interact with devices and futuristic environments. These devices and metaphors may be target of research considering they have proven to be useful before, as for example the Star Trek communicator (1966) similarity to the Motorola StarTAC phone (1996). Moreover, the impact of the new interfaces on the audience may indicate their expectations regarding future gesture interactions. Thus, the goal of this work is to collect and expose a compilation of hand interactions in Sci-Fi movies, providing an open catalog to researchers as resource to future discussions. The data visualization and analysis is facilitated through an \ open-source web application.

With the proliferation of digital cameras and smartphones, it is now common for travelers to record their micro activities in fine detail by taking photos without ever missing a moment. However, how to enhance the travel experience by utilizing such recorded micro activities has not been determined. Thus, we aim to 1) investigate how travelers record micro activities in photos through a user study and 2) design a system to enhance travel experiences utilizing travel photos. Based on the user study, we devise a “questification” strategy that motivates travelers to change their photos into quests. We implement a research prototype, Travel Q, a community platform that allows users to share their micro activities through photos. The results of a field study with the prototype suggest that questification is an applicable strategy for enhancing travel experiences.","Yoojung Kim","tendtoyj@snu.ac.kr","1. Cranshaw, J.

One of these stages is the intention retention stage, in which a person has to stay vigilant of the task and recognize when it can be carried out. Within the retention process there is the need to maintain groupings of tasks based on one’s areas of responsibility as well. To aid in task retention overall, external memory aids are often used. Still, there are occasions where intentions are not retained when external memory aids are used due to the aid’s inability to convey task information or cue execution of a task. In our work, we look to design an external memory aid that supports retention of individual task knowledge as well as retention of task knowledge in a user’s different areas of responsibility. With this tool we will observe its use to verify or deny its ability to support these two activities. We have conducted a survey of task management practices and results from the survey, along with related work, have aided in our initial design.","Sheriff Jolaoso","sheriff1@vt.edu","1. M. A.

We basically aim to answer two questions, first, personification of flexible devices can standardize emotional experience to the users and second, how valid would it be to intuitively use personified flexible device that changes its shape on notifying purpose. Through conducting a user study on 60 participants, we find that flexible devices that express emotion through personification can be standardized, and it is applicable to use these flexible personified devices to communicate with the users by notifying the users, allowing them to use the device more intuitively.

In this way, such systems can give the opportunity to more easily influence and participate in public affairs. However the lack of an efficient system of administration can delay delivering the collected reports to the relevant organizations or authorities. This paper presents a study of a citizen reporting system that was developed, implemented and tested in Uganda. This was done in collaboration with the Women of Uganda Network an organization to empower women using ICT. We studied an IVR system called U-Call that allows administrators to easily publish and tag audio reports over the Web (reported by citizen) using low generation mobile devices. We highlight a number of issues, including multiple authentication process that needs to be taken into account for future development. We emphasize the importance of field studies in understanding and designing for this user group and understanding the reality of the technical infrastructure available.

We hypothesize that the approach is well-suited for situations that do not allow for opposite-side hand interactions, e.g. while carrying something. In contrast to other methods such as speech input, it does not depend on external factors such as surrounding noise. In our pilot study in a laboratory setting, we compared same-side hand interactions using EMG against traditional opposite-side hand touch interactions to control a music player on a smartwatch. The results indicate that the same-side hand interaction approach is in general feasible for the envisaged type of interactions.","Frederic Kerber","frederic.kerber@dfki.de","1.

Recent work on gazebased CHI showed that a reader’s language skill can be inferred by gaze analysis. However, only few approaches have been proposed to identify those document parts a reader ﬁnds problematic. Our goal is to develop a computational method for reading incomprehension extraction. As preliminary work for such a method, we analyze which eye gaze features are useful for such part-based reading incomprehension extraction at three levels of document structure: paragraphs, segments and words. \ ","t.balley.ayanon0210@gmail.com","t.balley.ayanon0210@gmail.com","1.

We use depth sensing cameras to track the user’s hands above the surface and to recognize the point of interaction with a plain horizontal surface at a predefined height. This allows us to support various visual augmentation techniques such as visualizations of 3D hand contours, skeletons, and fingertips that provide visual cues for depth estimation when the hand is above the surface as well as cues for when touching the surface. The purpose is to provide the users with effective and intuitive indirect multi-touch interaction on a regular desktop PC.","Joel Lanir","joel.lanir@gmail.com","1.

With a single click to ‘favorite’ or ‘like’, social media users can demonstrate their interest in a specific person, event, or piece of content. In our research, we are exploring the translation of these lightweight social interactions into the physical world as design provocations. In this paper, we introduce one example called “I Like This Shirt”, a tangible manifestation of the ubiquitous Like button embedded in an interactive t-shirt. The shirt responds to physical touches, which indicate “likes” and tracks and visualizes the “like count” in real-time on the shirt itself. We describe our design and the results of a preliminary deployment.","Ladan Najafizadeh","ladann@cs.umd.edu","1. Arduino: http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardProMini. \ 2.

A better understanding of how interactive artifacts transmit norms can support designers and users to critically reflect about appropriate human and designed artificial behavior in context. In this paper we introduce ‘normative types’, which are artifacts that disable, guide, or empower people’s bodily actions, in order to deliberately address and explore what is normative physical action in context. We present four design explorations of normative types, named ‘Petal Table’, ‘Toilet Companion’, ‘Keep-Up-With-Me Table’, and the ‘Ring Fork’. Based on initial field trials we suggest that socially (in)appropriate bodily action can be imposed, exposed, juxtaposed, or opposed by normative types. We suggest that these modes of intention can aid designers in developing a critical self-reflective and contextually informed design approach.","Laurens Boer","laurens@mci.sdu.dk","1. Anderson, R. J.

Expressions, figures and explanations in the textbook are live, interactive elements. In contrast to canned illustrations and animations, \ students can interact with each textbook element. The rapid feedback loop with the database allows the user to explore and understand the full scope of valid and invalid queries to the database. Wireless connectivity allows the instructor to track classroom performance in real-time, merging textbook instruction with in-class demonstrations, allowing for the scaling out of classrooms.

Furthermore, proofreading of everyday writings has received little attention thus far, which is important for non-native speakers. In this paper, we propose SocialKeyboard that uses mobile crowd workers that can be contacted in a mobile environment. By embedding proofreading features into existing mobile keyboards, SocialKeyboard also achieves easy access anytime and everywhere in mobile environments. Moreover, it aims to induce faster responses by implementing 1) Push based task assignment to mobile crowd workers, 2) Real-time track changes, and 3) Synchronous task chaining of proofreading and verification. We present a first working prototype of SocialKeyboard and describe the interplay between Requester, Proofreader, and Verifier. Our preliminary evaluation showed promising results in terms of task speed, and we plan to perform a large-scale study in the near future.","Joohyun Kim","joohyun.kim@kaist.ac.kr","1.

To evaluate potentials and drawbacks of in-car 3D displays we mounted an autostereoscopic display as instrument cluster in a vehicle and conducted a real-world driving study with 15 experts in automotive UI design.  \ The results show that the 3D effect increases the perceived quality of the UI and enhances the presentation of spatial information (e.g., navigation cues) compared to 2D. However, the effect should be used well-considered to avoid spatial clutter which can increase the system's complexity.","Nora Broy","broyn@in.tum.de","1.

Good touch performance cannot solve the “fat-finger” problem, which results from occlusion and the size disparity between fingers and targets. We propose Hover Cursor, a method to improve small target selection using hover-sensing over a touchscreen. Using a capacitive touch sensor that also provides hover data, the hover position of the user’s finger is displayed with a cursor, and selection is performed with a tap. In a Fitts’ study, we compared Hover Cursor with direct-touch selection. Users made fewer selection errors with Hover Cursor. Hover Cursor was slower overall, but faster and more accurate for small targets.","Anna Ostberg","anna.ostberg@synaptics.com","1. Albinsson, P. and Zhai, S. High precision touch screen interaction.

Behind the scenes, however, there is a complex and error-prone choreography of multiple people controlling separate motion axes and camera attributes. This strict separation of tasks has mostly historical reasons, which we believe could be overcome with today's technology. We revisit interface design for camera motion starting with ethnographic observations and interviews with nine camera operators. We identified seven influencing factors for camera work and found that automation needs to be combined with human interaction: Operators want to be able to spontaneously take over in unforeseen situations. We characterize a class of user interfaces supporting (semi-)automated camera motion that take both human and machine capabilities into account by offering seamless transitions between automation and control.

However, most studies of online dating systems have focused exclusively on users’ abilities to find long-term relationships. This has restricted our understanding of how to design systems for users that have multiple relationship goals. To address this gap in understanding we explored how people use online dating systems in regards to casual encounters. We did this through an interview study with users of a popular online dating system in the United States and a study of online dating coaches who give behavioral advice specific to the pursuit of casual encounters. Findings highlight how users subtly disguise and probe for openness to casual encounters, while coaches try to overcome ambiguities in user intentions through a series of targeted dating methods.","Doug Zytko","daz2@njit.edu","WARNING: Reference 4 is very long.

To address this, we conducted surveys to collect the cognitive style of practitioners, educators, and those with both roles, followed these up by interviews. It was found that practitioners are more comfortable employing both analytical and intuitive approaches than the general population, and that the educator is able to suppress intuitive tendencies when performing analytical tasks. The profile of the educator who practices is different from the educator who does not practice, and the educator who does not practice is more evangelical about the subject. Recognising and accepting these differences is essential if we are to design a curriculum that supports the needs of the field.","Ann Austin","ann.austin@uwl.ac.uk","1.

Differences in hardware, architecture, and missing standardizations are just some reasons for this. We think that existing research is not versatile enough and too tailored to either single applications, hardware, or location. We contribute Connichiwa – a versatile framework for creating web applications across multiple devices. We base Connichiwa on four key goals: integration of existing devices, independence of network infrastructure, versatility of application scenario, and usability of its API. Connichiwa runs web applications on off-the-shelf consumer devices. With no external dependencies, such as a server, it enables a great variety of possible scenarios. We tested the technical feasibility of Connichiwa in seven example applications and plan to evaluate the framework and the usability of its API in a one-week Hackathon.","Mario Schreiner","mario.schreiner@uni-konstanz.de","WARNING: Reference 15 is very long.

However, for these systems to be useful, geospatial information needs to be presented in ways that those systems can minimize users’ difficulties of learning about a new place. This raises a fundamental question about what kinds and representations of geospatial information are effective in making a place more familiar, so that people can adjust to the place more easily even before visiting the unfamiliar world. This study focuses on modeling representations of geospatial information, and their effects on people’s familiarity of places. The results show that content and format of geospatial information matter in their familiarity about a place in terms of their perceptions and knowledge. Designers and researchers of social computing systems can benefit from this study so that geospatial information can be more effectively distributed through online systems.","Myeong Lee","myeong@umd.edu","1.

Prior work has predominantly focused on VA systems for relatively low-level analysts and managers; very little research has examined the particular needs of members of the “C-suite”, the top most decision makers in an organization. In this paper, we report on the unique contexts of C-suite decision making, discuss the broad spectrum of visual literacy of these users, and describe the corresponding VA system design and implementation requirements that must be considered. We conclude with implications for future enterprise-level HCI research.","","","","","","","","","","","","wip20312","","","","FormatComplete","","","","","","","Dec 31 19:00",""

We cannot afford to read every text in detail, hence we need to acquire strategies to quickly decide on the importance of a text and how to grasp its content. Additionally, the sheer amount of daily reading makes it hard to remember the gist of every text encountered. Research in psychology has proposed priming as an implicit memory effect where exposure to one stimulus influences the response to a subsequent stimulus. Hence, exposure to contextual information can influence comprehension and recall. In our work we investigate the feasibility of using such an effect to visually present text summaries that are quick to understand and deliver the essence of a text in order to help readers not only make informed decisions about whether to read the text or not, but also to build out more cognitive associations that help to remember the content of the text afterward. In two focus groups we discussed our approach by providing four different visualizations representing the gist and important details of the text. In this paper we introduce the visualizations as well as results of the focus groups.","Tilman Dingler","tilman.dingler@vis.uni-stuttgart.de","1. Baddeley, A., Eysenck, A., and Anderson, M. Memory.

The present research investigates this topic by focusing on impacts related to isolated colors and forms. First, a word association test showed that specific color and form characteristics are associated to ideas of threat or, on the contrary, of comfort. An anagram-solving test then demonstrated that color and form stimuli influence performance differently depending on these associations: Participants solved comfort-related anagrams faster when presented in combination with visual stimuli associated to comfort ideas (i.e., orange, round forms). Conversely, vigilance-related anagrams were solved faster when presented in association with visual stimuli associated to threat. These findings strongly suggest that color and form elements used in GUIs can impact user’s approach and sensitivity to specific information. Depending on the kind of tasks (e.g., demanding creativity or accuracy), the effects can either support solving or impair it. Further researches should transfer the present results to concrete computer mediated tasks.","Therese Dries-Tönnies","t.tonnies@gmail.com","[1]	Allport, G. W. (1948). The Genius of Kurt Lewin.

By taking advantage of recent advances in computer vision, the presented implementation enables real-time tongue gesture detection using only the video stream provided by a standard web camera. Tongue gesture detection functionality has the potential to supplement user interaction and provide for an immersive experience in applications such as games or video communication applications. It could also aid communication for mobility-impaired users. In this paper we describe the process of using YCbCr color space manipulation and a support vector machine to detect left, right, and downward tongue protrusions in real-time.","Chris Crawford","chris35469@gmail.com","1.

In this paper, we introduce Director, a novel, remote guidance mechanism for the positioning of people in outdoor spaces using mobile devices. We conducted a study to test our novel positioning technique, testing its guiding accuracy and effect on Preferred Walking Speed (PWS). Our results suggest that Director offers users a fun and playful experience, and that our novel guidance technique is a very accurate remote mechanism.","Liam Betsworth","liambre@gmail.com","1.

Our fieldwork has raised a number of questions which we discuss in this paper including: How can landscape tangibles be used as proxy objects, standing in for landscape and objects unavailable to the storyteller? How can tangible interfaces be used in an indirect or peripheral manner to aid storytelling? Can miniature landscapes aid recollection and story telling through embodied interaction? Are ambiguous depictions conducive to storytelling? Can topographic tangibles encourage inclusivity in group sharing situations? In this paper we share our initial findings to these questions and show how they will inform further TopoTiles design work.","Peter Bennett","peterdavidbennett@gmail.com","1.

The study presented in this paper serves as a preliminary exploration of virtual sandbox game environments as a co-design tool.

We postulate that by recognizing gesture execution phases from motion data that we may be able to auto-delimit user gesture entries. We demonstrate that machine learning classifiers can be trained to recognize three distinct phases of gesture entry: the start, middle and end of a gesture motion. We further demonstrate that this type of classification can be done at the level of individual gestures. Furthermore, we describe how we captured a new data set for data exploration and discuss a tool we developed to allow manual annotations of gesture phase information. Initial results we obtained using the new data set annotated with our tool show a precision of 0.95 for recognition of the gesture phase and a precision of 0.93 for simultaneous recognition of the gesture phase and the gesture type.","Sven Kratz","kratz@fxpal.com","1.

While new technologies such as mobile applications that help individuals measure, log, and reflect on their activities hold great promise, they rely on individuals already having the motivation to change their behaviors. How can technology motivate people in increasing their level of physical activity? We explore this question through the design, development, and evaluation of an automated assistance system that draws on a counseling method called motivational interviewing (MI) and utilizes a humanlike robot as a motivational agent. Through dialogue and nonverbal engagement, the agent enables individuals to talk about and reflect on underlying reasons for their lack of motivation regarding physical activity in order to increase intrinsic motivation for behavior change. In this work-in-progress, we describe our system design and discuss findings from a preliminary study that evaluated the impact of the robot’s use of MI on user motivation and behavior.","Toshikazu Kanaoka","kanaoka@jp.fujitsu.com","1.

Traditional document exploration interfaces require multiple keywords to be typed in, which is cumbersome and time-consuming using a touch-driven device. We present BigGo - an interface for exploration of documents using touch gestures. Our interface goes beyond common binary touch gestures as ""like"" or ""dislike"": the user is given a chance to not just provide binary feedback, but also explain why they like or dislike a certain document. Since the feedback is richer, it allows BinGo to provide a better recommendation of documents, and aid exploration of the documents. The ability to provide richer feedback improves the exploration experience and decreases the overall gesture cost for targeting the proper document set. User studies and the results show that BinGo outperforms binary gestural interfaces on recommendation quality while maintaining the usability on traditional like / dislike exploration mechanism on touch interfaces.","Arnab Nandi","arnab@cse.ohio-state.edu","1.

As understanding the information needs of users is crucial for designing and developing tools to support their social Q&A behaviors, in this paper, we present a new way of classifying questions from a design perspective, with the aim of facilitating the development of question routing systems according to individual’s information need.  As an attempt to understand the questioner’s intent in social question and answering environments, we propose a taxonomy of questions posted on Twitter, called ASK. Our taxonomy uncovers three different kinds of questions: accuracy, social, and knowledge. In addition, to enable automatic detection on these three types of information needs, we measured and reported on the differences in ASK types of questions reflected at both lexical and syntactic levels.","Zhe Liu","zul112@ist.psu.edu","1.

Today the concept of 'Energy Sharing' is often limited to householders 'selling' their surplus of locally generated energy to the energy grid. Rather than shared locally, transporting energy back to the grid results in a loss of energy through the power lines. The research aims to understand present and future social dimensions and values of energy sharing from a people's perspective. In this paper the Energy Management game 'Electric City', is presented and results from gaming sessions.The game serves as a platform for informants to reflect upon values and expectations associated with Energy Sharing.","Abhigyan Singh","a.singh@tudelft.nl","1.

However, co-located video games often move the focus toward a visual display and personal input devices.  This paper looks at how we can bring the focus back on the co-players providing for more intimate social play without losing the advantages of digital games and visual display.  Such games may provide social/relational benefits and increased enjoyment as well as may be of use for social learning, teambuilding, and therapy.  The design of our game, Mind Reader, attempts to both learn from non-digital games as well as exploit the potential of mobile devices to create a more social form of video game.  The game was built around two main features: face-to-face play and a shared physical space designed to promote social gameplay.  We then present a way to test this new form of gameplay against traditional mobile gaming to determine its effect on social interaction.","Ryan Courtney","rcourtney@cs.stonybrook.edu","1.

However, little has been studied as to why people adopt these devices and the real-world problems that they are solving in their lives.

Our novel issue-driven approach can complement the traditional budget classification system used by government organizations by addressing time-evolving public interests. BudgetMap elicits the public to tag government programs with social issues by providing active and passive tagging methods. BudgetMap then facilitates visual exploration of the tagged budget metadata. Through a lab study, we show how the design of BudgetMap helps users develop awareness and understanding of budgetary issues while identifying issue-budget links.

We developed a crowdsourced study online in which participants were presented with a series of images containing graphs and diagrams and asked to describe them. Each image was blurred so that the participant needed to click to reveal bubbles - small, circular areas of the image at normal resolution. This is similar to having a confined area of focus like the human eye fovea. We compared the bubble click data with the fixation data from a complementary eye-tracking experiment by calculating the similarity between the resulting heatmaps. A high similarity score suggests that our methodology may be a viable crowdsourced alternative to eye-tracking experiments, especially when little to no eye-tracking data is available. This methodology can also be used to complement eye-tracking studies with an additional behavioral measurement, since it is specifically designed to measure which information people consciously choose to examine for understanding visualizations. \ ","Nam Wook Kim","namwkim85@gmail.com","1.
